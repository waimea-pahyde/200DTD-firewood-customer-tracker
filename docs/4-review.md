## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Usability

To create the most efficiancy, I put the most necesary things as quick links on the home page, as well as adding a top bar with the same most commonly used quick links. As well as that, information about the customers phone number and address are placed at the top of the page, while their past orders are placed at the bottom. 


### Functionality

My website is functional, All the links lead to pages and the add and delete functions both work well. 


### Aesthetic

Using feedback from my end user, I created a website that was aestheticly pleasing, that also corrosponds to the colours of the brand logo and company. The end user also agrees that the website is aesthetically pleasing to them. 


### End-user

Using constant feedback from my end user, I have created a website that tailors to my end users needs, and makes life conviniant for them. 


### Accessability

Headings and titles are in large letters, allowing them to be read by people who may have low-vision. Along with that, there's a good contrast between text and their backgrounds.

## Overall Review

I produced a great outcome based on the feedback from my end user. Testing and trialling did reveal multiple things that needed fixing 

- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
