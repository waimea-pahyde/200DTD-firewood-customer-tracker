# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

This is my initial database design, linking the customer and it's data, to it's order, too what each order contains, and which woods are in each order.

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

I gave this demo to potential end users to see if they had any comments/feedback. These issues were raised. 

> There is no way to see all wood from home. 
> There is no summary of the types of wood sold
> There is no way to search for wood/customers. 
### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*IMPROVED FIGMA FLOW - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
