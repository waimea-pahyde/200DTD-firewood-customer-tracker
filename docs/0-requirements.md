# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My problem is that firewood merchants can't keep up with their customers, and would like to keep track of all the wood they have sold last year. 


## End-User Requirements

My website needs to hold and summarise customer data easily for the end-user. They need to be able to add and remove customers, orders, types of firewood, etc. 


## Proposed Solution

I will create a website that can

- Shows all customers

- Be able to add customers to the database

- Summarises the wood orders from previous years

- Search for customers in the list of all customers

- Removes customers from the database
